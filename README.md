# invoicing_extract_reformatter
CLI tool to read a master tracking spreadsheet extract and generate a reformatted spreadsheet capable of pasting columns into a copy the invoicing template.

I started out with the intention of doing this with Rust and quickly determined it would take a lot more work and time than doing it in Python, mainly because Python already has a lot of supporting libraries and some of the libraries for Python, where there are also Rust libraries, just have a richer interface built out.

Keeping this here because I want to dig deeper into the file in here with the extension traits because that looks useful as a concept.

I ended up meeting my initial goal over at tims-cli-tools repo.
